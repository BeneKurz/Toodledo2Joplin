# Toodledo2Joplin

Import Backup of Tasks or Notes created with https://www.toodledo.com to Joplin https://joplinapp.org/

You need:

-   Python 3.X
-   Toodeldo Backup file created from here: https://www.toodledo.com/tools/import_export.php
-   An Joplin API TOKEN which is created from within the Joplin Desktop App using the Web Clipper

How it works:

-   Put the name of the Toodledo backup file into the variable TOODLEDO_IMPORTFILE and put the Toodledo backup file into the same folder as the main script.
-   Put the Joplin API TOKEN into the Variable API_TOKEN
-   Start the script, good luck!

If You find a problem, please open an issue.
